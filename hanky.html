<p>darkmage of evildojo reporting in.</p>
<p>darkmage hanky has left the material plane. darkmage is incredibly
heart-broken by the rapid series of events leading to this end. today
would have been day 9 of her suffering, but she decided to leave this
world with her head in my arms and my sister on the phone telling her
that we loved her very much.</p>
<p>for those who do not know, hanky is the first dog i’ve had as an
adult human being. she wandered into our lives on march 2, 2022. my
sister called me to tell me she’d picked up a dog she found literally
wandering the streets. when i came over, i immediately fell in love and
knew that she was my dog.</p>
<p>we’ve had a wonderful time together and i regret not having spent
more of it with her, or having been more of a helicopter dog-dad to have
observed the events from a clearer perspective, or to have been more
preventative with her care, or to have been more aware of her advanced
age and symptoms.</p>
<p>i wish i had an exact answer as to what happened, or what went
wrong.</p>
<p>here’s what happened from my perspective:</p>
<p>day 0, 2023-05-27: somewhere around this time, i remember catching
hanky trying to drink some rain water that had formed in our backyard
after a storm. i had always been careful to keep her from doing things
like that. every so often she would find a way to sneak it in. i can’t
say that this is definitively what triggered the following series of
events but it could have been a catalyst.</p>
<p>day 1, 2023-05-28: hanky begins vomiting small amounts of water all
over the apartment and doesn’t eat anything. i didn’t think much of the
not-eating: hanky was a big girl and had a big apetite, but sometimes i
was over-feeding her, and she would have a day where she wouldn’t eat,
and would resume again the next day. when we lived alone, just us 2, i
didn’t force her to eat at certain times of day. i would just fill her
food bowl up twice a day whenever i saw it empty and she would eat on
her own time. i tried to sync it with my own meals, because she was
always ready to ask for a piece of whatever i was eating in her own way.
hanky was not a vocal girl, but she communicated gently by curling up
next to you and pawing at you as if to say “hey, can i try some of
that?”</p>
<p>hanky had some light vomiting in the past, but nothing like this
before. i regret not taking her somewhere sooner.</p>
<p>we continued our regular routine that day, walks and all, but she did
not pass stool.</p>
<p>day 2, 2023-05-29: hanky continues to vomit small amounts of water.
everyone is wiping up after her. i honestly wanted to call the vet, but
my sister seemed insistent that hanky was “just backed up” still. i
tried not to worry.</p>
<p>we still continued our regular routine. she did not throw up during
our walks, but she did not pass stool either.</p>
<p>day 3, 2023-05-30: i’m very worried and call the vet. we set an
appointment for day 4, first open slot they had. hanky continues with
previous symptoms. every single day, even up until the last, she
continued to drink water. this day, she passed a stool, her last normal
one, but also walked around the backyard very clenched-up like she was
constipated.</p>
<p>day 4, 2023-05-31: we go to the vet. they give her an anti-nausea
injection called ‘cerenia’ as well as take her blood tests and x-rays.
no obstructions found, concerned about distended stomach, but otherwise
we would find out more once the test results came back. hanky began
walking very woozily and rapidly began losing her strength, collapsing
on herself after very short distances.</p>
<p>day 5, 2023-06-01: we receive a call from one of the doctors at the
vet. hanky had ‘elevated white blood cell count’ and ‘needed to be on
anti-biotics right away’. she also had ‘4 out of 5 indicators of liver
failure’. i thought back to what i had read about bacterias found in
texas water ways and bacterial movement through rains. we schedule a 2nd
vet visit for the next day, though the first open slot was in the
afternoon, we were told “if it gets worse to come in earlier”.</p>
<p>day 6, 2023-06-02: one of the vets claims to have tried to call me,
but i don’t have anything in my call logs from them. i bring hanky in,
and she is given fluids for a few hours, along with the anti-biotics and
another shot of ‘cerenia’. i realized later that i was never informed of
the side-effects of ‘cerenia’ nor do i have any paperwork i might have
signed involving it. i’m now wondering if hanky is a victim of
malpractice. i know how the law works but that is another story.</p>
<p>hanky comes out very woozy again, after having passed a ‘black tarry
stool’, and techs post her up in my car’s backseat. the tech told me to
go to the ER if she passes that kind of stool again. i bring her home,
family helps her out to do a peepee, she managed to walk down the
sidewalk past a neighbor’s house before she collapses and pees. we bring
her home and she sleeps with me on the couch in the living room.</p>
<p>day 7, 2023-06-03: a big explosive event between my sister and i.
while im looking up information in order to make an important
decision.</p>
<p>thinking back, the timeline must be off, because the last 2 nights, i
had hanky sleep in my bed with me.</p>
<p>at my old apartment, when it was just hanky and i, i had my
memory-foam mattress on the hardwood floor. it was a convenient,
low-effort sleeping arrangement for myself. setting up bedframes is a
pain in the ass. but, when i got hanky, it was very nice for her. she
was able to sleep in my bed all day if she wanted. when i was up working
at the computer, she would sleep in my bed. it was a special, rare thing
to wake up to her getting into bed with me. she was sometimes finnicky
and touchy about how and where to could pet and touch her.</p>
<p>ever since moving in with my sister, her boyfriend, and grandma, i’ve
been asked to make a lot of sacrifices. one of the ones that has pissed
me off to no end not allowing me to have my mattress on the floor like i
used to. in fact, currently, i have my mattress stacked on top of
another mattress simply because my sister and her boyfriend have nowhere
else to store that mattress. all i wanted was for my dog to be able to
get into my bed with me again. i am sad that it took things going this
far for that to happen but at least i know that she got to spend her
last nights in bed right next to me, kissing her forehead and telling
her what a good girl she is, she smiling the whole time.</p>
<p>in the days before, i had managed to get hanky to eat half a chicken
patty on day 5, and a handful of sardines on day 3, but she was
rejecting most food. a dog rejecting food is incredibly scary and cause
for concern. there are so many things that could cause it and unless you
have all of the information, you may not be able to diagnose it in
time.</p>
<p>i even tried making her some kick-ass soup broth, and mixed it into
her water to try and trick her into getting some nutrients. for days, i
thought: she just needs some nutrients to kick-start her system. she was
still drinking water, if she tastes how good this soup is, she’ll want
to eat eventually.</p>
<p>she drank plenty, even up until the last day.</p>
<p>day 8, 2023-06-04:</p>
<p>i don’t want to think about how this all went down.</p>
<p>hanky’s situation went downhill fast. she was just fine 8 days ago,
but has progressed through various stages of degenerative illness. her
tongue was hanging out, she was no longer licking water, and she had
done business in my bed. i had towels down, but her stool matched the
description the tech gave me. i called the ER, which didn’t matter. i
got my car into position and had my sister’s boyfriend carry hanky to my
backseat and i hauled ass, constantly checking to see if she was still
breathing.</p>
<p>i blocked several cars because their parking lot was absolute trash
and ran inside to get someone to come out to my car and get hanky.
pretty good i was lit up dominating the room, exclaiming at the “3-4
hour wait while my dog is dying in my car”. they sent someone out
immediately, thank god and christ.</p>
<p>maybe 15 minutes later, im in a cold, sterile room explaining hanky’s
condition to one of the ER staff, who relays it to the doctor. the
doctor comes in and asks me what i want to do.</p>
<p>i told her that i did not want hanky to suffer anymore. my worry was
that, if we continue to try and fight this thing off, even if i had all
the money in the world, that she would just be in pain the whole time,
and that is not what i want.</p>
<p>hanky is the love of my life. the love of life itself. for all of the
reasons i have wanted to leave this miserable planet, hanky is one of
the reasons that i want to stay. she never complained about anything,
even to her dying moments with me.</p>
<p>they brought her in and i curled myself around her. my sister called
me and was able to say she loved hanky into hanky’s ears. i told her i
was gonna spend some time with hanky and we hung up. not even a moment
later, i watched hanky’s last breath leave her body, her head cradled in
my arms. hanky did not wait to be put to sleep: she waited until she
could be with me to make her departure.</p>
<p>i sobbed, and sobbed, and have been randomly sobbing all day. it was
a lot like this when mom died. i wasn’t able to be present for that. i
wasn’t also able to be present when other dogs in my life passed on:
buddy, georgie, and winnie. i greatly loved them, and have never fully
processed their departure.</p>
<p>there are many loved ones in my life whom i have not fully processed
their passing, but maybe that’s the point. maybe we never truly finish
processing that. maybe its a process that is with us forever, like a pid
0. maybe it has its own process-space seperate from userland. are
emotions in the kernel of our mind?</p>
<p>hanky’s impact on the world is going to be felt greatly by everyone
in the coming weeks, months, and years to come. new things will arise.
projects will emerge. her memory will be etched into the akashic
record.</p>
<p>i feel like i am a robot operating on autopilot right now. i do not
understand how i am going to move forward. i do not understand a lot. i
want to be angry at someone. i want to be able to point a finger at god
and say “you did this to me!”. it is ok to be angry. what isn’t ok is
using that anger as a justification to hurt someone. there’s a
difference between going sideways at someone before you’ve had your
coffee versus actively plotting and planning to go out and commit random
acts of violence.</p>
<p>so, let’s say life is as short as it is.</p>
<p>what sort of crazy, fucked-up shit can we get into and avoid
prison?</p>
<p>hanky was guiding me back then, and she is guiding me now.</p>
<p>soon she will be home and she will never leave again.</p>

really mean and fucked-up to you.</p>
